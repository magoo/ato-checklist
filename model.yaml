  from: 
  - password_successful:
  - host_executable_malware_local:

  from: 
  - host_executable_malware_local:
  - host_rogue_app_local:
  - session_exposure:
  - host_browser_extension_local:

- on_device: The attack originates from device.
  from:
  - device_confirmation:

mitigations:
- unique_complex_password: The password is unique, complex, and hard to guess.
  from:
  - dictionary_attack:
  - reused_password:
  - brute_force:

- device_confirmation: Platform requires reasonable device confirmation (AuthTables)
  from:
  - password_successful:
  - token_mfa_successful:

- session_pinning: Application fails if ip/session doesn't match.
  from: 
  - session_weakness:

- sms_mfa: SMS based token required
  from:
  - mfa_enabled:
  - password_successful:
  
- totp_mfa: TOTP MFA required (Rotating codes)
  from:
  - mfa_enabled:

attacks:
- compromise_email: Compromise email, lift SMS codes or confirm devices.
  from: 
  - sms_redirected:
  - device_confirmation:
- social_engineer_support: Convince customer support that you are the proper account owner.
  from: 
  - pw_reset:
- compromised_email: Registration email address is compromised
  from:
    - pw_reset:
- totp_seed: TOTP generation seed compromise
  from:
  - totp_mfa:
- totp_predict: TOTP generation predictable
  from:
  - totp_mfa:

- session_weakness: The session can be guessed / predicted. The JWT signature is not checked.
  from:
  - application:

- app_weakness: Unknown vulnerabilities allow auth / pw reset mechanisms to misbehave.
  from:
  - application:

- dictionary_attack: Adversary attempts common passwords (dictionary, statistical) against the account.
  from:
  - password:
- reused_password: Adversary acquires re-used password from a related breach.
  from:
  - password:
- brute_force: Adversary attempts all passwords.
  from:
  - password:
- host_executable_remote: The target is keylogged. (Passwords exfil'd remotely. No device usage.)
  from:
  - password:
- credential_phishing: Target is delivered credential phishing.
  from:
  - password:
  - network:
- session_exposure: Session information (tokens, cookies, auth headers) are exposed.
  from: 
  - network:
  - app_weakness:


- host_executable_malware_local: Target is keylogged (malware) and local browser storage abused.
  from:
  - remote_device:
- host_browser_extension_local: Target is keylogged (browser extension) and local browser storage abused. 
  from:
  - remote_device:
- host_rogue_app_local: Target is using an imposter application.
